# LaTex Setup

This repository contains a basic LaTex Setup.

## Getting Started

Every new tagged commit pushed to GitHub will be converted to a release and append the converted PDF as asset.

## Configure CI Pipeline

To be able to use the pipeline, CircleCI needs a Personal Access Token from your GitHub Account.

The Acces Token with the Key `GITHUB_TOKEN` must be set as Environment Variable in the CircleCI Project Settings.
